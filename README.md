# Intelligent PDF Summarizer - all my troubleshooting efforts. 

In this lab project, I initially tried to follow the default setup provided by the original GitHub repository, which used Azure AI services like OpenAI and Form Recognizer to analyze and summarize PDF documents. However, despite successfully configuring my Azure resources and adding my OpenAI key, the summarization part was not working. The orchestrator was triggering correctly, and the blob was being read, but the call to OpenAI was either failing silently or not returning the expected results. I double-checked environment variables, deployment settings, and logs, but nothing pointed to an obvious error. I suspect that quota limits or restrictions in the free-tier OpenAI access on Azure might have been the cause.

After spending a lot of time debugging the OpenAI-based approach without success, I decided to switch to a simpler, local mock version of summarization. In this approach, I removed OpenAI integration and instead returned a basic mock summary using the first few lines of the analyzed PDF content. Although this local version executed successfully, another problem emerged: the Form Recognizer client was not accepting my connection due to the development environment using HTTP instead of HTTPS. Azureâ€™s DefaultAzureCredential() and secure clients require an HTTPS endpoint, and when run locally with Azurite (which only supports HTTP), the DocumentAnalysisClient failed to authenticate.

In summary, both methods had blocking issues. The OpenAI-based summarization did not work as expected despite being configured correctly, and the local mock version failed due to security restrictions in Azure's SDK when using Form Recognizer without HTTPS. These challenges reflect some of the real-world obstacles developers can face when working with cloud-based AI and storage services, especially in constrained local environments.
